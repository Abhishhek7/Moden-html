Q(2)What are HTML Entities?  list out 5 commonly used HTML Entities?
    ANS:Some characters are reserved in HTML.

    If you use the less than (<) or greater than (>) signs in your HTML text, the browser might mix them with tags.
    
    Entity names or entity numbers can be used to display reserved HTML characters.
    
    Entity names look like this:
    
    &entity_name;
    Entity numbers look like this:
    
    &#entity_number;
    To display a less than sign (<) we must write: &lt; or &#60;
    
    Entity names are easier to remember than entity numbers.
    five commonly used entities are as follows
    non-breaking space	&nbsp;	&#160;	
    <	less than	&lt;	&#60;	
    >	greater than	&gt;	&#62;	
    &	ampersand	&amp;	&#38;	
    "	double quotation mark	&quot;	&#34;
